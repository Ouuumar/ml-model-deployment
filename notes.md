Still needed :

(kaggle api command line to download csv [optionnal])
dataprep validation

Git :

When create new branch :
git checkout -b <branch_name>
git push -u origin <branch_name> (create the upstream to link remote and local)

When feature is done, rebase it :
git push --rebase origin main (do it on your feature branch)
